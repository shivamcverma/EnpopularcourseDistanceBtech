          "B Tech distance education is a correspondence course at the UG level with a time span of three to four years. Some important subjects taught in the B Tech correspondence course include Engineering Physics and Mathematics, Computer Programming, Engineering Mechanics, Engineering Graphics, Data Structures, Machine Design, and Analog Circuits. The primary goal of distance BTech courses is to offer flexibility who find it inconvenient to pursue regular BTech courses in India.",

B.Tech CSE provides a more in-depth, engineering-oriented education, while BCA offers a more application-focused curriculum, which can make it a faster path to industry entry but may lead to fewer advanced technical roles without further study."

Also not ignoring that the online education has bought much ease for teachers and students but on other side it has made studnets a bit lazy and unattentive towards their studies. Also the remote areas lack of infrastructure has proven a great challenge for children who are in villages and also living in town. So yes not probably a good thing for Indian Higher Education. You cannot do practices sitting on laptop which needs a proper lab and appraturs like the engineer students the architecture and design students."
